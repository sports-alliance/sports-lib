# Import activities

Use `SportsLib` to import recorded activities. GPX accepts a DOM parser in Node.js, TCX accepts a parsed XML document, FIT accepts binary data, and native JSON restores a previous Sports Lib export.

Activity types are normalized through `ActivityTypesHelper.resolveActivityType()` before they are stored on
activities. For example, `snorkeling` resolves to `Snorkeling`; `Mermaiding` is a canonical diving activity
when a provider supplies that sport name. A provider-specific numeric FIT mapping is added only when the FIT
profile or a representative file establishes one.

```sh
npm install @sports-alliance/sports-lib @xmldom/xmldom
```

## GPX

```ts
import { SportsLib } from '@sports-alliance/sports-lib';
import { DOMParser } from '@xmldom/xmldom';

const event = await SportsLib.importFromGPX(gpxText, DOMParser);
const activity = event.getFirstActivity();

const distanceMetres = activity.getDistance().getValue();
const heartRate = activity.getStreamData('Heart Rate');
```

## TCX and FIT

```ts
import { SportsLib } from '@sports-alliance/sports-lib';
import { DOMParser } from '@xmldom/xmldom';

const tcxDocument = new DOMParser().parseFromString(tcxText, 'application/xml');
const tcxEvent = await SportsLib.importFromTCX(tcxDocument);

const fitEvent = await SportsLib.importFromFit(fitArrayBuffer);
```

The FIT parser applies the profile scale to record-level `depth`, `next_stop_depth`, summary depth, and bottom-time
fields. Sports Lib stores those SDK-scaled values directly as canonical meters or seconds without another conversion.
The parser emits FIT `avg_vam` in meters per second; Sports Lib converts that present source value to its public
`Average VAM` metric unit of meters per hour.
Parser 4 exposed FIT session field 196 (`metabolic_calories`) a second time as `resting_calories`. Parser 5 retains
only the canonical name, which Sports Lib imports as `Metabolic Calories`; it does not substitute the value into
`Resting Calories`. Existing activities must be reparsed to gain `Metabolic Calories`; existing `Resting Calories`
values in native JSON remain readable.
Suunto depth values also remain canonical meters. Depth is available as an advanced chart metric; callers can request
`Depth` explicitly through `ActivityParsingOptions.streams.includeTypes`.

Garmin `single_gas_diving`, `multi_gas_diving`, and `gauge_diving` sub-sports resolve to `Scuba Diving`;
`apnea_diving` and `apnea_hunting` resolve to `Free Diving`. These are direct FIT profile mappings and all remain in the
Diving activity group.

Diving activities exclude terrain summaries—`Ascent`, `Descent`, altitude min/max/avg, and grade min/max/avg—whether
they were imported from a FIT summary, restored from native JSON, or would otherwise be hydrated from streams. Depth
represents dive vertical movement. Any source altitude or grade stream remains available when explicitly requested.

FIT session and lap `intensity` enums are retained as the string-valued `Intensity` stat. Values follow the FIT profile,
such as `active`, `rest`, `warmup`, `cooldown`, `recovery`, `interval`, and `other`.

Cadence-shaped source fields are normalized by activity context. Swimming, open-water swimming, rowing, indoor rowing,
kayaking, canoeing, paddling, and stand-up paddling expose `Stroke Rate` in `spm`; other activities continue to expose
`Cadence` in `rpm`. The same rule covers streams plus activity and lap summaries, and prevents both semantic families
from being emitted for one activity.

Use `importFromSuunto(suuntoJson)` for Suunto JSON. Use `importFromJSON(eventJson)` only for Sports Lib's native `EventJSONInterface` representation.

Native JSON hydration preserves explicit stats, except terrain summaries excluded for the Diving activity group, and
fills missing pace, swim-pace, and grade-adjusted-pace summaries from compatible speed summaries on events, activities,
and laps. This keeps older speed-only exports readable with the same derived-stat behavior as newly parsed files;
serializing the hydrated model includes the additive derived stats.
It also converts cadence-shaped data to stroke rate for the supported activity types, so stored native JSON does not
require reparsing from FIT, TCX, or GPX. Pool-swim length JSON keeps its existing `avgCadence` property name while
hydrating that value as `DataStrokeRate`.

Complete native event JSON contains the activities that determine event-summary semantics. Summary-only native event
JSON receives the same treatment when its `Activity Types` stat is present. When an application persists neither, it
can opt in after hydration by calling `normalizeActivityMetricSemanticsForStats(summary, contributingActivityTypes)`.
The helper changes only unambiguous homogeneous stroke-rate summaries and removes terrain summaries from homogeneous
Diving-group summaries; empty, unknown, and mixed activity-type inputs remain unchanged. Sports Lib does not infer
relationships omitted by an application-specific persistence layout.

### 20.0.2 native-JSON migration

Restoring existing Diving-group native JSON now removes terrain ascent/descent, altitude min/max/avg, and grade
min/max/avg summary values from events, activities, and laps. No source-file reparse is needed for the restored
in-memory model. Re-serializing that model intentionally omits those values; raw source streams remain untouched.

Activities expose one-second streams and typed stats. Read numeric values with `getValue()` and display-ready values with
`getDisplayValue()`. Depth presentation follows the first swim-pace preference: `/100m` selects meters and `/100yd`
selects feet, while serialized source values remain meters.
